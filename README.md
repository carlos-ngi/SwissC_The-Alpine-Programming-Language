## SwissC: The Alpine Programming Language
SwissC is a satirical C-language dialect that brings the charm of the Swiss Alps directly into your terminal. By replacing standard C keywords with Swiss German (Schwiizerdütsch), it transforms rigid programming into a cozy, local experience.
Whether you're from Zurich, Bern, or the Grisons, SwissC makes your code sound like a conversation over a fondue pot.

# Features
Dialect-Driven Syntax: No more main() or printf(). We use hauptteil() and usdruckef().
Transparent Integration: Works on top of any standard GCC/Clang compiler using a custom header or a compiler wrapper.
Zero Performance Overhead: Since it uses C preprocessor macros, your code runs just as fast as "boring" English C.
